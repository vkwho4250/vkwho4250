Hi there!

My name is Victoria and welcome to my GitHub: https://github.com/vkwho4250.

I am a Front End Developer with experience building responsive websites using JavaScript (ES6+), React, HTML, CSS, Sass, and more. My portfolio (www.victoriaho.me) showcases my passion for creating with code so feel free to contact me if any sparks your interest! 

I’m also a self-motivated and avid learner who’s passionate about exchanging complex problems for actionable solutions. As a result of my work experiences, I excel in delivering quality while meeting end-user needs, contributing to collaborative teams, and being resourceful when faced with new challenges. 

Being a web developer allows me to be creative and curious without compromising the inherent problem-solver in me and I’m eager to learn new and better ways to produce accessible, intuitive, and memorable digital experiences that consistently deliver.
